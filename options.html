   <h1>About</h1>
   <p>
      Last.fm Scrobbler for Chrome was created for people who listen to music 
      online through their browser, and would like to keep an updated playback 
      history using last.fm's scrobbling service.
   </p>
   <h4>By now the only supported website is YouTube</h4>
   <p>      
      As I don't visit many other websites with video content, the development of 
      <i>connectors</i> for other websites will be mostly up to you. Feel free to 
      send a pull request at <a href="http://github.com/david-sabata/Chrome-Last.fm-Scrobbler">GitHub</a>.

      The core of this extension is based on <b>mortenfriis</b>'s work which unfortunately
      doesn't seem to be working right now and original author is not responding 
      to commits or even worse - the website code updates, making the extension useless.
